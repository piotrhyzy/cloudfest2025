# CloudFest Poland 2025 Presentation: Automating PR Reviews with Vertex AI and Gemini

This repository was created to accompany the presentation given at CloudFest Poland 2025 on the topic: **"Enough with PR stress, let's allow Vertex AI and Gemini to do the job!"**

## Presentation Context

The presentation explored how to leverage Google Cloud's Vertex AI and Gemini models to automate and improve the code review process. The core idea is to reduce the stress and time commitment associated with manual Pull Request (PR) reviews by offloading some of the tasks to powerful AI models.

## Repository Contents

This repository contains a demonstration of a prototype PR review automation application. It is designed to illustrate the concept of using AI to analyze code changes, suggest improvements, and provide feedback in a PR context.



## Important Notes

*   **Prototype:** This is a prototype/demonstration and might not be ready for production use without further development.
*   **Model Versions:** The exact behavior of the system will depend on the specific versions of Vertex AI and Gemini models used. The notebooks probably contains the model name used, and configuration.
*   **Credential Management:** Be sure to handle your Google Cloud credentials securely.
