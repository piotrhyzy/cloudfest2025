# Pull Request Summary:

This PR introduces new functionalities to the project, including:
*   A `Makefile` for easier testing and linting. 🛠️
*   New functions in `experimental.py` for value checking, breadth-first search, and Arabic-to-Roman numeral conversion. ➕
*   A `power` function in `main.py`. ➕
*   A `combine_values` function in `math_utils.py`. ➕
*   A `modify_string` function in `string_utils.py`. ➕
*   Adds `pytest` and `flake8` to `requirements.txt`. ➕

**Highlights:**

*   The addition of a `Makefile` streamlines development workflows with `test` and `lint` commands. 🚀
*   The `experimental.py` file introduces algorithms like breadth-first search and number conversion, expanding the project's capabilities. 🧠
*   The `combine_values` function in `math_utils.py` attempts to combine two optional integer values, but its current implementation is inefficient. ⚠️

# Review Summary:

The review highlights the following points:

*   Unnecessary `pass` statement in `experimental.py` should be removed. 🗑️
*   The logic behind reverse iteration in the `arabic_to_romanian` function in `experimental.py` should be clarified with a comment. 📝
*   The purpose of the loop in the `power` function in `main.py` should be explained with a comment. 📝
*   The `combine_values` function in `math_utils.py` is inefficient and can be simplified. 🐌
*   The nested loop in `modify_string` function in `string_utils.py` has O(n^2) complexity and should be reviewed for efficiency. 🐌

# Overall Quality Assessment

The PR introduces valuable new functionalities, but some areas require improvement based on the review comments. The `Makefile` and new functions significantly expand the project's capabilities. However, inefficiencies in `combine_values` and `modify_string` and lack of comments in some functions need to be addressed.

# Merge Assessment

The PR should **not be merged** until the review comments are addressed. Specifically, the `combine_values` and `modify_string` functions should be optimized, the unnecessary `pass` statement removed, and the suggested comments added. Once these changes are made, the PR can be merged. 🚦
