# Review of Changes:

This pull request introduces several new functions and modifies existing ones across multiple files (`experimental.py`, `main.py`, `math_utils.py`, and `string_utils.py`). The changes range from minor improvements in readability to significant concerns about efficiency and code placement.

## Major Changes

*   **`experimental.py`:**
    *   Modified `check_value` to use `int | None` and added a docstring.
    *   Added `run_breadth_first_search` for breadth-first search implementation.
    *   Added `arabic_to_romanian` to convert Arabic numbers to Roman numerals.
*   **`main.py`:**
    *   Added `power` function to calculate the power of a number.
*   **`math_utils.py`:**
    *   Added `combine_values` function to combine two optional integer values.
*   **`string_utils.py`:**
    *   Added `modify_string` function to repeat a string based on its length.

## Issues

*   **`experimental.py`:**
    *   `run_breadth_first_search` uses `queue.pop(0)` which is inefficient for queue operations. Should use `collections.deque`.
    *   `run_breadth_first_search` contains an unnecessary `if n == node: pass` block.
    *   The file contains unrelated functions and should be split into multiple files.
*   **`main.py`:**
    *   The `power` function is misplaced in `main.py` and should be moved to `math_utils.py`.
    *   The `power` function can be simplified by using the `**` operator.
*   **`math_utils.py`:**
    *   The `combine_values` function uses an inefficient loop-based addition. Should use direct addition.
    *   The file contains invalid lines `pytest` and `flake8` that should be removed. These belong in a requirements or configuration file.
*   **`string_utils.py`:**
    *   The `modify_string` function is inefficient due to repeated string concatenation. Should use `"".join()`.
    *   The `modify_string` function lacks a docstring.
    *   The `modify_string` function has a vague name and should be renamed to something more descriptive (e.g., `repeat_string`).
    *   The `string_utils.py` file contains a useless line `version 3` that should be removed.
    *   The `modify_string` function does not handle the edge case of an empty string input.

## Overall Quality Assessment

*   **Correctness:** Most functions appear logically correct, but some implementations are inefficient.
*   **Readability:** Readability varies. Some functions have good docstrings, while others lack them. Variable names are generally descriptive.
*   **Maintainability:** The code's maintainability is affected by the presence of inefficient implementations and misplaced functions.
*   **Efficiency:** Significant efficiency concerns exist in `run_breadth_first_search`, `combine_values`, and `modify_string`.
*   **Security:** No apparent security vulnerabilities.
*   **Completeness:** Some functions lack proper error handling or edge-case considerations.

## Merge Assessment

‚ùå **Do not merge.**

This pull request requires significant revisions before it can be merged. The identified issues related to efficiency, code placement, and missing documentation need to be addressed. Specifically:

*   Refactor `run_breadth_first_search` to use `collections.deque` and remove the unnecessary conditional.
*   Move the `power` function from `main.py` to `math_utils.py` and use the `**` operator.
*   Refactor `combine_values` to use direct addition.
*   Remove the invalid lines `pytest` and `flake8` from `math_utils.py`.
*   Refactor `modify_string` to use `"".join()` and add a docstring. Rename the function to `repeat_string`.
*   Remove the line `version 3` from `string_utils.py`.
*   Add unit tests for all functions to ensure correctness and robustness.
*   Consider splitting `experimental.py` into multiple files based on functionality.

Once these issues are resolved, the pull request should be re-reviewed.
